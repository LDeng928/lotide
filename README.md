# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @ldeng928/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@ldeng928/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.head([1, 2, 3]) // => 1`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

- `head.js`: Return the first element of an array
- `middle.js`: Return the middle element(s) of an array. If the array only has one element, it will return an empty array.
